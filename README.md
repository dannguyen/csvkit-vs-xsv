# Why learning how to work with data from the command-line (e.g. csvkit/xsv) is the best thing you can do no matter how good/bad/overwhelmed you think you already are at Excel/SQL/RStudio/Jupyter/pandas


This repo started out as a short guide comparing the extremely useful command-line tools, [BurntSushi/xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv) and [wireservice/csvkit](https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit). But the writing quickly became a brain splurge of *"there are too many ways to talk about how these tools make exploring/wrangling/analyzing data so much easier"*, and *"boy all those times at NICAR/school/work when a little knowledge about the command-line and text files would've saved people hours of painful struggling"*. So I've decided I should make this repo bigger than a single README.md file, including creating a list of recipes and scenarios and packaged data in the [data/ dir](data/). 

```sh
cat data/fec-contribs.csv \
    | csvgrep -c committee_name -r 'BETO|CRUZ' \
    | csvgrep -c contributor_employer -r 'FACEBOOK|APPLE|AMAZON|NETFLIX|GOOGLE' \
    > senate-faang.csv
```

(It's a work in progress.)

I have a few Gists in which I've copied-pasted some crazy one-off scenarios to look at later. At the time, csvkit fit in perfectly as a nice hack before doing "actual" coding/engineering -- no guarantees if the gists make sense or even work (all of them refer to many other tools used in combination with csvkit):
