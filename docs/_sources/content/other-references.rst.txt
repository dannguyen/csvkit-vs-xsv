I also have a few Gists in which I've copied-pasted some crazy one-off
scenarios to look at later. At the time, csvkit fit in perfectly as a
nice hack before doing "actual" coding/engineering -- no guarantees if
the gists make sense or even work (all of them refer to many other tools
used in combination with csvkit):
